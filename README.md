AI ESR Signal Classifier 

Project Overview
This project implements an AI-based signal classifier for ESR-like data. The goal is to classify synthetic electron spin resonance (ESR) signals into three distinct classes based on their characteristic patterns:
Class 0: Single Gaussian-like peak
Class 1: Double Gaussian peaks
Class 2: Irregular / high-frequency noisy pattern
The dataset is generated programmatically using Python and is designed to mimic realistic ESR measurements, including natural variability and noise.
This project serves as a proof-of-concept for AI signal classification using PyTorch and demonstrates a combination of signal processing, machine learning, and scientific computing.
